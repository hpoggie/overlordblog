This is a blog about the development of the card game Overlord.

Overlord is a competitive card game influenced by CCGs like Magic and Hearthstone, though Overlord itself is not a CCG (it doesn't allow deck customization). Overlord is built around two core mechanics:

1. The closer to losing you get, the more powerful you are.

2. The vast majority of cards are played face-down. At the start of your turn you turn cards face-up. So your opponent has one turn to interact with whatever you're doing, but doesn't know what it is.
