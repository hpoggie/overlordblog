title: Overlord Design Principles
---

1. Games should be fun at high skill levels.
	This means they should be balanced and deep. They should not have degenerate strategies.

2. Games should be accessible to beginners.
	This means they should be as simple as possible.

3. Games should be biased toward ending.
	This means it should be impossible to have an endless game. In Overlord, almost every aspect of the game is pushing it toward completion.
