title: Ran on two computers
---

Ran Overlord on my LAN for the first time today. Everything is working
fine. Panda3d is oddly slow on my desktop, though, which is strange
because my desktop's specs are much better than my laptop's and it runs
fine on my laptop. Maybe I compiled panda3d wrong.

I'm also worried about the difficulty of deploying panda3d games.
I haven't looked into that much.
