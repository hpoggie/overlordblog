I am not dead.

Overlord is coming along. I've been busy recently and haven't had a whole
lot of time to work on it, but I've done a few things. Namely, the digital
version is a lot more stable now.

I'm considering several rule changes. I might decrease the maximum mana
cap to make games faster. I'm also thinking about making the decks
smaller.
